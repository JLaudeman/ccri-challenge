# ccri-challenge
A solution for the Grid-Cell neighborhood problem for CCRi

## Running the code
The examples specified in the original challenge (and a few others) can be run with `python3 examples.py`. Note that I have commented out example 14. It takes about a minute to run.

Or if you prefer, open a REPL, `import challenge, numpy`, and then use `challenge.find_neighbors()` with a 2D numpy array.
